JqueryDatepicker
================

JqueryDatepicker is a simple Rails plugin that integrates jQuery Datepicker (http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker) with your Rails application.

Installation
=======
Go to your application dir and type

script/plugin install git://github.com/wadomo/jquery_datepicker.git

IMPORTANT!

You must include in your layout ( if you don't have yet):

<%= stylesheet_link_tag :all %>
<%= javascript_include_tag :defaults %>

That's it! Now you can add a datepicker field in your view.

Example
=======

Add this to your view.

<%= datepicker_input "user","birthday" %>

Where "user" is your model name and "birthday" the name of the datefield.

You can also use it with the form helper like:

<% form_for(@user) do |f| %>
	<%= f.datepicker 'birthday' %>
	<%= f.submit 'Create' %>
<% end %>
